# Bob Kelso's Easy Ways to Track An Employees

  ## Description

  - This project is a great way to stay on top of different departments within an organization. You can update your departments, view all the roles within a department, and then also see all of the employees with their role ID's, salaries, and departments. 
  - I feel like anyone who has a small business could possibly benefit from this project, maybe even medium sized businesses where there are around 150-300 employees. Of course any huge businesses like the hospital in my project would greatly benefit from this project as they'd be able to use this to monitor thousands of employees. I'm sure Dr. Kelso would love this if he knew how much money it'd save him.
  - This was project was a great way for me to practice how MySQL works as a unit between a static http request with express or using inquirer to command line prompt for interactive purposes. I think I would use this in the future if I ever wanted to do something like monitor all the gifts I need to get for my 56 cousins every year. It's really a useful resource for many different aspects.

  ## Installation
  
  To install this application, please follow these steps:
  
  - This project required the installation of inquirer, mySQL2, and console.package. I ran an npm install for each of these, inquirer needing to be version 8.2.4, and once the code was ready for launch I went ahead and ran mysql -u root -p, adding my password just to describe my tables and verify the information was correct, then I ran npm start to get the project going.
  
  ## Usage
  
  - You can use this project by first running npm start once you are cd'd into the correct folder. You will be given a series of prompts in which you can interact with the different databases that are provided, including department, role, and employee.

  ## Contributors

  - This time around it was rewatching lectures from class, including the mini project, which is why I was starting the project using express instead of inquirer. I did also get help from a few online forums to understand the Switch statement. We learned about it previously but I didn't realize it's usefuleness until this project. 

  ## Tests

  - This project is best tested by running npm start and following the prompts, any errors should be catched if something is not filled out right and if everything is filled out correctly you will see updated databases whenever you view any of them.
